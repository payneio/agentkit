* Makefile needs to detect changed src files
* agent2agent communication
* Get a proper logger
* Advertised addresses should try to look up IP addresses.
* An agent doesn't necessarily need a coordinator... just another agent and 
  we can use a gossip protocol to find the other data... but maybe not an
  appropriate design.
